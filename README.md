# Web Development Fundamentals with MDN

This repository is a personal learning journey through the world of web development, guided by the comprehensive resources available on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs. It serves as a structured collection of my progress, notes, and projects as I delve into the essentials of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning process, track my progress in web development, and share my journey with others who might find it useful. It is structured to reflect the learning path provided by MDN, covering various web development fundamentals in a step-by-step manner.

## What's Inside

1. Will Start with bulding a small website using basic html, csss and javaScript.
2. Going to add essential javaScript concepts on the way of learning.
3. Client side programming (understanding HTTP methods, jquery library)
4. Server side programming (express/nodejs or Flask for building Restful Apis)
5. Projects

## Learning Resources

This journey is supported by MDN Web Docs, an open-source resource for developers that provides comprehensive documentation on web standards, technologies, and best practices. You can find more about MDN and its resources here: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
